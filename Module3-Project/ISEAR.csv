head. My drives and actions did not match this so consequently I

I'm expected to go to communion and I would but I was afraid and

alsatians and farm dogs with my escape route blocked by a shut  
fence."

unfortunately are the dirt of society, intelligent, fashonable,

expensive place in town drunk as a skunk. Whats more she drove  
home and couldn't remember doing so. I was disgusted by her state  
and her actions."
2734,shame,"A good friend of mine told me in comfidence that once he had  
tried to commit suicide. To meet him you wouldn't think so. I

or a snake. But I mean it in a social aspect when somebody had  
behaved like a scoundrel to you, when by his actions he has made  
you change your attitude towards him but I thing this feeling the  
way I meant it, is not typical for the people interrelations."

2776,joy,Meeting a loved man.
2777,fear,"I felt a physical fear, if I can call it this way, today, in the bus where

yours and you are at the bottom of it."

University. I was at home, the atmosphere was still, though I  
myself was full of suspense. I tried to do different things. When  
the telephone rang and...! Yes, of course there were other  
situations when I felt a similar feeling but I was unmindful of  
them."

terrific thought that I might lose the man I loved !"
2785,anger,"Anger I felt when my boyfriend told me he didn't mind breaking it  
off with me, i.e. each of us to take his own road. Because until  
that moment, he deliberately restricted our dates. The motives  
were brought to my knowledge later."
2786,sadness,"Sometimes, when I'm alone I am seized by this feeling. But it

is worth. Very often this feeling is caused to me by people -  
friends who I love and respect."

catering establishment. It is a result either of the look of the  
food or when watching the way some people eat."

2789,guilt,"Quite unconsciously I offended a girlfriend of mine. It was  
really worthy to pass this fact over in silence, but I acted so,

feel guilt, after I have already done the deed."
2790,joy,When I was admitted to the University.
2791,fear,"I had to have my tonsils out. I had been making up my mind almost

me, of the unknown."
2792,anger,"In a conversation my boyfriend expressed definite and quite  
pretentious opinions and he took up an attitude towards a theory  
which he himself had never known. His information was from

carry him some promised papers. I haven't done it until this day.  
Now I feel quite awkward when I meet him."

studies in the first year because of unpassed exams."

later he died."

because it was a supplementary examination. I passed the exam  
very well and was glad because I recovered my selfconfidence."

most of all. I remember I was horror stricken before my  
microbiology exam, because it was a decisive one."
3016,anger,"It was necessary to organise a competition in connection with a  
celebration. Everyone was to be present at that event. It turned  
out that there was no audience at all because everyone had  
pretended to be very intelligent and no one had come. I got  
furious."
3017,sadness,"When I part with my friends I feel always sad for some time. I  
can't remember a concrete example now. For example I have just  
parted with a friend of mine and I am feeling sad."
3018,disgust,"In autumn I had to move to another lodging. My landlords, quite  
intelligent people, warned me I had to move in the nearest  
future. But I had difficulties in moving my luggage because I  
couldn't wait for a car to come. How amazed I was to hear them  
threatening me they would throw our my things. And at that my

quite  disappointed and disgusted."

next day I felt sort of ashamed when I remembered what I had said  
and done on the night before."
3034,guilt,"Last year I put off an exam for the autumn session without

close to my best friend looking straight into the eyes."
3092,fear,"I had to tell someone that I was interested in remaining celibate  
and alone. And that my spiritual master strictly prohibited

despite my own being hurt in the process."
3093,anger,"In a sociology class I felt very angry towards some members of  
society for exploiting the Polynesian people, dawn raids by  
Police (Martin Luther King, Blacks in S.A.). But this was just a  
reflection of my own shortcomings."

a potential success in various areas of society. (So stupid this  
emotion)"

3-4 yrs; she was no longer a waitress but a meter maid for  
Council."

got only blankness."

as neat/tidy as in the past. I'd not seen her a year - She

and taking 3 University exams part time)."
3101,sadness,"When my father a 4th/5th generation colonial (from Eng.) attacked

saddned me."
3102,disgust,"People who came to our home - and requested ""Put out your smoke"".  
That we should not smoke in our house... and asked not even  
politely. It disgusted me because I think people need to adapt to  
the situation."

friends dinner. Told ""Not to Speak"". The attitude by him was  
negative/I was in mid 20s, I had done many things - a wide range  
of experiences. Probably greater than he."
3104,guilt,"Not attending school, when  am not sick - but in need of mental  
rest. Staff on your return query your ""sickness"" - it is easier

etc."

3106,fear,"A truck (big one) nearly mowed me off the road (I was driving a

family occasion that I should not have missed."

""paper work"" collecting bags and the anticipation of coming  
through the customs gate."
3120,fear,"I caught a huge eel on a fishing line which I had pulled into the  
boat. I cut the line and threw the whole lot back into the water.  
Later that day and about ten miles away I went swimming and  
someone made the comment wondering how far eels could swim, I  
abruptly ended swimming for fear at an unseen eel for a few days  
until we had left the district."
3121,anger,"My partner without discussing with me the situation decided it  
was time for us to have a break and went ahead and arranged his  
own life for the next 6-12 months, then told me the day before it  
was about to happen having been tolerant and friendly for the  
preceding week."
3122,sadness,"I had been living in an overseas city and made the decision to  
leave the city and come home about 12 months before I met a whole  
new set of friends, leaving them at the airport was sad and  
traumatic as they had helped me in many ways and I knew I  
wouldn't see many of them again."
3123,fear,"After I had managed to fail my first year at University I was  
scared as to what I was going to do with my future. I didn't want  
a mundane 9-5 job and yet I didn't know if I could pay my way  
through an unsubsidized year at university to settle down and  
continue my studies."
3124,anger,"This situation keeps occurring - when my little sister disagrees  
with me or vice-versa. We have very similar temperaments and I  
always end up feeling angry at her and myself for fighting so  
much over unimportant trivial matters."
3125,sadness,"When my grandmother, who has been living with us for 14 years,  
had a stroke and was left paralysed on one side. She has been  
quite close to our family and to see her suffer in this way makes  
me feel really sad."
3126,disgust,"A gathering of a social sports club at which they proceeded to  
show pornographic videos and then afterwards (when most people  
had had quite a bit to drink) carried on in a very degrading,  
unmoral manner - especially females exposing and flaunting  
themselves with no shame or embarassment."
3127,shame,"Like guilt - the most ashamed I have ever felt was when I began  
to feel guilty about having sex with my boyfriend when it was  
only ""the thing to do"", and not really an act of love."
3128,guilt,"This feeling of guilt really applies to moral/religious views. I  
(being Catholic) went against what I was brought up to believe in  
and had a sexual relationship with my boyfriend. Many months  
later, when I was doing some deeper self analysis I began to feel  
guilty and realized that I had gone against what I wanted for  
myself and my future."
3129,joy,"My mother along with some of my friends gave me a surprise  
birthday party - they invited a large number of my friends along  
too."
3130,fear,"My mother did not come home till late at night (Ages ago). Anyway  
if I don't know where my parents are and when they'll be back I  
start thinking that perhaps they have had an accident and are  
perhaps dead."
3131,anger,"Because I am the Captain of a basketball team I usually organise  
a roster system so that everyone in the team can have a turn at  
doing either a duty or a ref. A lot of the time the girls can't  
be bothered or just forget - I usually have to fill in."
3132,sadness,"So as to be closer to the university I have left home and moved  
into Auckland. It now seems as if I have left home - especially  
my family - forever."

is quite happy for him to play around - as well as herself."
3134,shame,NO RESPONSE.
3135,guilt,"I did not attend a social studies observation class for 1 whole  
week (I am a student trainee teacher). Anyway the other teachers  
thought this was okay because the teacher I was supposed to  
observe was not well liked. The teacher was in fact really nice  
to me - but I wanted to get out of teaching a hard topic he had  
given me."

pharmacy completed."

Catholicism but then once received - o.k."
3143,joy,"Joy for me is when all my family gather around home for special

family and relatives and to observe natures productivity process  
which have been going on for centuries."
3144,fear,"I had this experience of fear when few people were fighting at a  
social one night, which one of my relative was involved. My fear  
was greatly for him because he was being assaulted badly."
3145,anger,Never really had the experience just yet - N/A.
3146,sadness,"This occurred when my girlfriend and I have to finish our  
relationship due to some circumstances between her and her  
family. I was really sad, hurt and couldn't really find any  
reason why am I still living. Is this life is all about ? This  
was one of few question which crept up vividly every time I  
thought about what had happened."
3147,disgust,"I'm very disgusted when I see people abusing their body with  
drugs and alcohol. They take advantage of these things usually  
for an excuse for the fantasies which they like and so they do  
things stupidly and unjustly."

3156,guilt,"When I had to lie about my age to be accepted as a member of a  
group."
3157,joy,"My cousin asked me to be a bridesmaid for her. This made really  
happy because I was adopted into the family and her asking me  
made me realise that she saw me as a cousin and not just another  
person. There were other cousins she could have asked but she  
asked me."
3158,fear,"That if ever I was really naughty I would be sent away from my  
Mum and Dad to another family. I was fostered from age 5 and  
didn't get to Mum and Dad until I was 6 and then legally adopted  
at 14."
3159,anger,"(1) My father died. (2) My natural father contacted me a year  
after my father died and this angered me more as I thought he  
should be dead and not my father."
3160,sadness,"My father died. I was away at the time and did not know until two  
days after."
3161,disgust,"A child told me she had been sexually abused by her step-father.  
I only knew the child and had not come into contact with either  
parent. I tried to do what was best for the child. The event and  
the stepfather disgusted me."

what I call real name."
3163,guilt,"I lied to my mother in the sixth form she said she would ring to

3171,joy,"When my lover and I felt like we had gone full circle. And our  
relationship was new, fresh, vital etc. once again."
3172,fear,"My daughter was 2 yrs she went up to a colt tried to hit it. It  
turned on her and kicked her over the heart, sent her flying  
through the air. I left my mother and sister to deal to her as  
they are nurses. I felt I didn't want to know if she was going to  
die, it was just too much."
3173,anger,"My anger is with men, their inability to be human (not all men)."
3174,sadness,"The saddest I've ever been was when my lover was killed,

felt at the time I had to relay the information back to the  
person concerned, as I felt the situation volitile, did this  
without telling my lover, she felt like piggy in the middle, as  
she was not directly concerned. Maybe you could call it gossip I  
felt different after I had slept on it. If I had waited, thought,  
NOW I would not have done it."
3178,joy,"A good friend, the wife of the vicar of my church came up to me  
from the pews (I am in the choir) and shook my hand during the  
time for an informal ""greeting"" in the church service. She said a  
few words."
3179,fear,"I walked up the main street of Auckland at 10 o'clock at night. I  
expected it to be very active with people, gangs, fast cars etc,  
thought it was actually quite quiet, though also oppressive. I  
walked about half a mile and bought a drink along the way."
3180,anger,"Someone in my family (my brother I suspected) ate a bun which I  
had made for myself. It was during a long telephone call after I  
had just made it and put it in the oven warming drawer."

friendly with. After her talking for some time with another girl  
I decided it wasn't her in fact that someone miming her, which it  
was when I finally looked. I was talking to a friend at the time."

that a bathroom tap had been left to drip with a faulty fawcet."

between a boy and girl soon to be married, in my flat after I

and didn't previously know about I suspect."
3185,joy,"My friend replying to my letter and again saying he was attracted  
to me and suggesting we write, talk and get together and see how  
things went and his suggestion that I could ring and doing that it  
was really good - though really insane conversation."
3186,fear,"Being sexually assaulted (not rape, but passionate kissing) by a  
friend's father - he stopped when he was driving me home. I  
hadn't wanted the lift, had refused 3 times, and then felt it'd  
be rude to refuse again. Was really afraid of what he might do."
3187,anger,"I live by myself and a few weeks ago was woke by a man on the end  
of my bed coming up my bed at me. I was really angry, told him to  
get out. He was surprised, hesitated; I started to move towards  
him and he backed off - kept telling him - loudly, but firmly to  
go. Because I'd got the initiative, I succeeded. A very powerful  
message."
3188,sadness,"When my grandmother died - I wasn't sad so much that she'd died  
because she was old, but because she lived in the last few years  
in an old people's home and had nothing very much that was hers -  
no chair, or private space, and when I went to visit she would be  
sitting in the ""lliving"" room the TV room. It was hopeless. And I  
felt awkward so I didn't go and I was sad 'cos how I couldn't."

drunk."
3210,anger,"Deliberately provoked by someone close. Angered by the  
deliberation not the provocation."

well catered for. This position fulfils a lot of my aims for the  
last five years of my life."
3216,fear,"When I decided to leave my steady, secure employment to come to  
university. Because I didn't know if I could cope with all the  
requirements of study and also being older I didn't know if I  
would enjoy mixing with younger people, also financial  
insecurity."
3217,anger,"When a close friend failed to live up to the expectations I had  
of him - thereby causing pain to his spouse. I believe that my  
anger was probably a reaction of fear that I wouldn't be able to  
live up to my own expectations."

sharing in the sorrow of her parents who were left behind."

unwillingness to challenge him about these attitudes in order to  
keep the peace."

3236,joy,"I was feeling really low - had been a series of fights with my  
siblings, been under pressure at school and wasn't going to the  
party I wanted to go - instead I was going out with my family. A  
guy called and said, in effect, that I was ""nice"" and he liked  
me. Hence the emotional joy."
3237,fear,"I was watching a movie alone - it was a horror movie. The music  
was a deep pulsing type - not really music. And a light flashed  
on and off. It was in the complete darkness of a movie theatre  
that was almost empty."

3258,fear,Haven't been frightened for ages.
3259,anger,"I visited a special education school. The headmaster applied a

could have avoided."
5953,joy,"The day I was happiest was the day when I received a phone call  
from Eve's Weekly to inform me that I had won the first prize of  
the All India Essay competition.  I had won this prize when I was  
an under-graduate when even post graduates had participated.  I  
had been judged by eminent judges and political scientists."
5954,fear,"Fear is an emotion that I experience very often.  Naturally this  
is during exams and subsequently while waiting for the results.   
However there is one occassion when I was paralyzed with fear.   
This was when I was doing my M.A.-I, and we had a series of student  
lectures.  I was one of the participants and my lecture happened  
to be the opening lecture.  I had been confident all morning, about  
twenty minutes before the lecture, my confidence started failing  
me.  I felt my heart go cold, my lips go dry and I was really  
paralyzed.  This incident of fear is still fresh."
5955,anger,"I experience this emotion quite often but the day I was most  
angry was the day I got pulled up for something I had not done.   
It happened during my school days, I had not spoken a word in  
class but the monitor had written my name on the board.  So I  
had a remark in my callender which I had to get signed by my  
parents.  This remark resulted in me being spanked."
5956,sadness,"I have once been very sad and lonely.  This was when I was trying  
to organize a play as a student (15 years).  Instead of  
materializing, it fizzled out.  The worst thing was that the play  
fell apart completely and I found myself weeping uncontrollably.   
Now when I think of it, I laugh it off; but at that time it was  
intense."
5957,disgust,"This is an incident that many of us witness in our everyday life  
in a city like Bombay.  One day I was travelling by bus, three  
men dragged two fellows out of the bus.  Once outside they were  
beaten into pulp.  These two fellows, who got beaten, were pick-pockets  
and they were being beaten by all and sundry.  I thought to  
myself -""what is life?"".  It is one hell of a place where  
everyone is after someone else.  One waits to cut the throat of  
the other one just for a living, (money).  When I think about  
such things - the purpose of life, etc, I feel very disgusted and  
dejected."
5958,shame,"This is an event I will never forget.  I am considered a good  
mimic.  This particular day we were waiting for a professor  
to take her class.  This  professor had a peculiar accent and a  
very horrible way of lecturing and to top it all we had this  
class at the fag end of the day.  So this particular day I got  
into my element and started imitating the professor, and the  
professor entered the class right in the middle of it .  I was  
unaware of her presence, some of my friends tried to warn me but  
it was of no avail as I was too engrossed in mimicing.  Then I  
suddenly noticed the silence and turned around to see her  
entering the class.  I do not know till today if she actually saw  
what I had been doing or she had completely ignored it.  Through   
out that lecture I died of shame.  All the more shameful was the  
fact that she gave me a character certificate. "
5959,joy,"This happened when it was finally confirmed that I had stood  
first in the university for the M.A exams.  A few days before the  
official results were declared a clerk had brought the results  
unofficially.  So I had been expecting the results but the  
confirmation allowed me to legitimately feel happy at my  
success.  
"
5960,fear,"This was when I was being followed home every day from the campus,  
by a stranger.  He would follow me to the campus and then sit  
outside my class.  If I was not there he would ask my friends as  
to where I was.  He was a dark, ominous looking person and I was  
terrified of him as I did not know his intentions.  I reported  
him to the security officer, who turned him over to the police.   
I was even more petrified then."
5961,anger,"A new gas connection was to be installed and the mechanic who came  
to do it was very rude to my mother and me.  I rushed to thhe  
dealer with my mother and had a fight with the dealer as he  
seemed to be unreasonable and was taking the mechanic's side.   
Ultimately the matter was resolved after my father went and spoke  
to him.  The mechanic was asked to apologize."
5962,sadness,"The day I was to receive my gold-medal for the M.A, my  
grandmother, who I loved very much, died after an illness.  She   
died a few hours before the convocation.  While I was  
attending the convocation I had to control my grief as she would  
not have liked me to miss it.  It was a day she had been waiting  
for, but did not get to see. "
5963,disgust,"We had come back from a programme and we were all (three girls)     
staying over at another girls placce.  One of them started  
passing very nasty and outright bitchy remarks at me.  It was  
brought on by a male colleague's compliments to me, this girl was  
herself interested in this guy.  Bitchiness and catty remarks  
made by women never fail to disgust me.  I can particularly  
remember this incident as she knew that I had not encouraged the   
guy."
5964,shame,"I was learning judo and my instructor wanted me to assist him in  
teaching girls judo at a suburban college.  I was just a beginer,  
and he made me a green belt so that I would be able to command  
respect.  This was against my principles, and yet I allowed myself  
to listen to him.  I gave it up soon after, however I felt very  
ashamed at not sticking to my principles and at not having put my  
foot down earlier."
5965,guilt,"I was coming back home with my mother when the purse I was  
carrying got stolen.  It was done so swifty that I did not  
realize what had happened till much later.  A lot of money and the  
keys of the house were lost.  I was guilt ridden at my  
carelessness.  I felt terrible as I do not normally loose things  
and this was quite important, especially the keys. 
"

70% of the Indian poulation is still below the poverty line."
5977,guilt,"I read about the national and social spirit and self-discipline  
of the people of developed coutries like U.S.A, England, France,  
Germany etc.  Comparing this to the Indian people I felt guilty  
as they have no national spirit or self-discipline."
5978,joy,"I felt happy at the settlement of our marriage, even though we  
are from different socio-linguistic backgrounds our parents  
agreed to the wedding without any conflict or discussion.  We had   
thought that they would object to the wedding but it did not happen. "
5979,fear,"One day, early morning my mother who is healthy fell ill.  There  
was no doctor or compounder near by and for a few hours -8 A.M to  
6 P.M she did not speak a single sentence, nor did she drink water  
or  milk.  There was no movement in her body and I felt really  
scared.  I almost lost my confidence about her survival."
5980,anger,"One day my elder brother badly scolded my father.  This was the  
first time that I heard such abusive language from my brother.  I  
requested him humbly not to use this kind of language but he did  
not care for what I was saying.  Finally I picked up an axe to use  
against him, in the meanwhile people intervened."
5981,sadness,"My close friend and I applied to TISS for admission last year,  
unfortunately he failed to get admission.  We had done our graduation  
together and are quite involved with each other, so we had wanted  
to do our Masters degree together.  However, it did not work out  
as we had expected it to and this saddened me."
5982,disgust,"My classmate at TISS has the habit of biting his nails and ever  
since my childhood I have never liked this habit.  This person is  
near me in class, dining hall and the campus so I suggested that

of them studies in a private school and the other one is  
repeating his form five.  They do not know what they are doing.   
They follow every word of their teachers, books and systems.   
They always try to rationalize their bad acts by some game and  
they are satisfied with their awkward life.  I have tried to  
persuade them very often but have failed.  This time I had a  
fight as they have no voluntary spirit (they did not polish the  
floor)."
7144,sadness,"I have been thinking of changing my major for a few months.  My  
original major was Chinese language and it blocks my way.  I have  
to face many problems at the sametime and I do not know what is  
real and virtuous.  I do not know if I am not interested in  
Chinese or if there are other factors which make me sad.  I am  
not very clear on what I can do for the study of Communication  
and Journalism.  I am not clear about what I can do.  What are  
the limitations ?   I hesitate but I feel more adjusted now."
7145,disgust,"I had been forced to get together with strange and disgusting

my room-mate called me to ask me to go out for a stroll.  I tried  
to make an excuse so as not to go out but she refused to listen

satisfied and happy and the cumulative anxiety disappeared.  I  
only wanted to cry out that I had succeeded."

chair and looked at my fellow students all around.  I was really  
scared that they would ask me some questions or challenge the  
ideas that I had presented."

and restless all day.  When I saw them I really wanted to slap  
each one of them."

college for our lecture and I saw him with her.  He put one arm  
around her shoulder and laugher brightly and joyfully.  I did not  
dare and did not want to look, just walked by them quickly.  The

silent.  But I did not want A to know and so I left him and went  
to F.  I should have expected this to happen."

it was really bad luck that she had examined the list of the  
students who were late."

song ""Those were the days"" that guilt feeling became stronger.   
The lyrics described well - I was really wrong.  The wish that I

secondary school and she would not be disappointed and gloomy  
because of me."

7297,sadness,"When my mother went through an operation, it was not very serious  
but I was sad and could not sleep before the operation."
7298,disgust,"During a recent meeting, Mr. A showed his excitement and  
overindulged in the notes delivered.  Though his curiosity could  
not be blamed, his way of accquiring knowledge was an extreme  
behaviour e.g he always tried to know what I was reading and  
gained everything he could."
7299,shame,"When I was doing my homework at home, some relatives came and  
advised me to help my mother do the house-work."
7300,guilt,"While quarreling with my brother I broke the glass door of the  
cupboard and a china doll.  We were scolded by my father for  
breaking the door but we did not tell him about the door."

them."
7319,disgust,"It was a narrow and dirty passage which was located near the  
market and I had to stand there to wait for people."

someone, and this had embarrassed the this person.  And I  
still meet the person."
7321,guilt,I said something which was against my conscience.

horror film shown on T.V."
7324,anger,"I worked with several classmates on a project.  I was very  
anxious about the project while my partners showed no concern   
and when we had meetings on the project my classmates  did not  
pay any attention.  Some of them read books while the others  
argued on irrelevant questions.  The meeting would go on for two  
hours without the main theme being discussed.  We wasted time and  
could not reach a compromise.  My classmates avoided doing the  
work and the responsibilities, they seemed to value other  
projects more than this one."
7325,sadness,"One of my good friends had to migrate to America.  Our friendship  
had developed quite well and it was a pity as our friendship would  
fade."
7326,disgust,"In a study group, a person always liked to argue on some  
unimportant, irrelevant and minor points.  He tried to persuade     
others in an unfriendly way.  He was obstinate and would not accept   
other's point of view."
7327,shame,"Once my presentation was the worst among my classmates as I had  
not prepared it well and had not seen it as important.  My  
presentation was so confused that it clearly showed my poor  
preparation."
7328,guilt,"I joked with an unfamiliar friend in an obstinate tone.  I was  
afraid of his misunderstanding me and being hurt and angry at me.  
 I felt sorry over my conduct and thought that I had to find an  
opportunity to apologize."
7329,joy,"I remember my religious experience.  During  a gospel camp, a few  
friends of mine decided to believe in God.  The joy that I felt  
at that time was more than words can express.  I blessed them and  
praised God in my heart."
7330,fear,"My friend and I had offended our classmate unintenionally.  We  
wanted to apologize to her so we decided to visit her.  We knew that she  
was stubborn so we were frightened.  When we rang her door bell,  
our fear was at it's climax"
7331,anger,"My girlfriend disliked it when I played majong (a game of gambling).   
I expressed my regrets and when I went to see her she neglected my  
existance.  I was very angry and left in displeasure."

developing this relationship and it was unsuccessful, I felt very  
sad."
7333,disgust,"My classmate got a ""B"" for his homework while I only got a ""C"".   
When we got the results he acted as if he did not merit this  
grade.  I found that his humility was hypocritical and I found it  
disgusting."
7334,shame,"Once in primary five, I had forgotten to take a book to class and  
the teacher punished me by asking me to stand at the back of the  
class.  I thought about the way my mother would react if she saw  
me being punished.  My mother was very good to me and though she  
did not see me punished, I felt sorry for her."
7335,guilt,"I had fixed a meeting with my classmates and I missed it as I was  
tired.  Besides everyone at the meeting was a stranger to me and  
I did not want to make friends with them.  Whatever the reasons - I   
felt guilty."
7336,joy,"I learnt from the newspaper that I had been accepted at the  
Chinese university of H.K.  It was 7 o'clock in the morning.   
Later I told my family and relatives about it and had tea with  
them very joyfully."
7337,fear,"I was camping in an old broken hut which had no lights.  I had  
brought along a lamp which was not working very well.  The door  
made strange sounds and I was sure that strange things were  
happening.  The most terrifying bit was that there were many  
wardrobes in the hut and everytime that I looked in the glass of  
the wardrobe I felt that there were ""objects"" behind me.   The  
whole night was spent in fear and restlessness."
7338,anger,"During a football match, the other team was rude and they hurt my  
team members and me.  The coach was prejudiced against us and  
punished us unreasonably.  Later we fought with each other and  
the match had to be cut short."
7339,sadness,"I heard of the death of a closefriend of mine.  I had gone camping         
with him shortly before his death and the whole thing seemed very   
sudden to me. "
7340,disgust,"A  group of youngsters dressed in fads talked foul language on a  
bus.  They also insulted the  pedestrians on the road and were  
impolite to the passengers of the bus."
7341,shame,"In a Christian gathering's lucky draw I mistook a girl's name for  
mine (a boy's name).  I realized my mistake only when I went up  
to the stage for the prize.  I did not know what to do as  
everyone was looking at me.  I blushed and went back to my seat."
7342,guilt,"While playing basketball I broke a team member's spectacles.  His  
face was injured by the  pieces of glass.  It was not serious but  
I felt guilty and blamed myself for being too careless and  
vigorous in my game."
7343,joy,"After a busy day I went back to my hostel.  I closed the door and  
had a drink, then I read my favourite book on the bed.  Suddenly  
I felt peace and joy."
7344,fear,"When I went home and there was nobody, I waited till 2 A.M and       
still nobody.  I was suddenly scared and anxious as this had never  
happened before.  In addition my mother was very weak and I  
feared that she had met with an accident.  Therefore I was anxious   
all night."
7345,anger,"Yesterday I read in the newspaper that a 30 year old woman had  
abused her 2 month old son and had caused his death.  I was very  
angry after reading this as this is not a human act and to abuse  
so fragile a life is not a forgivable sin."
7346,sadness,"I had a schoolmate who went to the hospital as her brain was  
bleeding.  She fell unconscious for three days and when I went  
to see her I saw the miserable state the family was in.  Moreover  
I could not do nothing for her.  I was very sad.  Finally, she  
died."
7347,disgust,"A tiresome person held me up all day long.  I was very busy then  
(I can not remember what the problem was).  He continously tried  
to make me talk to him and disturbed me."
7348,shame,"One day, when I was sitting on the bus, there was an old woman  
standing beside me.  I was very tired and sleepy and did not  
think of giving her my seat.  A 50 year old woman who was sitting  
beside me got up and gave her seat to the old woman and said,   
"" Old woman, please take my seat, the youngstters these days are  
not used to giving their seats to others.""  When I heard these  
words I was very ashamed of myself and wanted to get off the bus  
at once.  "
7349,guilt,"After an exam I was in a very bad mood as I had done it very        
badly.  At home, my mother took so long to ask me how things had   
gone that I lost my temper.  I overreacted and made my mother cry.  
She still prepared lunch for me and did not scold me .  Suddenly,  
I thought that it was my fault and I started crying.   
"
7350,joy,"I was appreciated by others, especially my family members and my  
friends."
7351,fear,"Whenever I am alone in a dark room, walk alone on the street,  
sleep alone in the room at night or see something which is only  
partly visible.  This emotion was very strong when as an 8 year    
old child I saw something horrible.  "
7352,anger,"[ Whenever I put myself in other's shoes and try to make the  
person happy, comfort him or make friends and I am misunderstood  
and rejected, especially when this person is a family member or a friend.]"
7353,sadness,"There was a conflict of interest between me and a close friend of  
mine.  He only thought about his own interest and not about our  
friendship.  This behaviour hurt his friends.  Another incident  
is when a friend isolated himself without giving any reasons."
7354,disgust,When I saw a lot of rubbish and animal waste on the floor.
7355,shame,"When I was emotionally unstable I said things which may have hurt  
others or made them feel unhappy.  When I calmed down I realized  
that I had been selfish and had not taken into consideration the  
feelings of others.  Then I felt ashamed as someone pointed out my  
behaviour to me."
7356,guilt,"[ When I break someone's things out of carelessness, or do something   
to make others feel unhappy  or hurt the self-esteem / self-confidence   
of others, especially if they happen to be friends or family members.]"

be a Chinese university student, I was excited as I had longed  
for it."
7358,fear,"One day when I was a little boy, my friends asked me to play  
with them outside and to catch some boys.  However our parents  
did not know that we were out and when I got home it was very  
late and I feared being scolded by my parents."
7359,anger,"When I learnt that a friend of mine had talked about me to  
another friend and had said wrong things about my abilities and  
attitudes.  I was very angry."
7360,sadness,"About two years ago my girlfriend suggested that we separate.   
This really gave me a shock as I had never thought that she would  
say such things.  The reason she gave me was that we were not  
suited for each other."
7361,disgust,"Once while studying for my exam I found so many complicated words  
that it disgusted me."
7362,shame,"When I was young I felt ashamed when our relatives visited us and  
I hid myself."

than expected.]"
7365,fear,I am scared when I stroll alone on the Chung Chi college campus.
7366,anger,"One day, I discussed a very important question with A.  A  
suddenly declared that he would not accept my position and  
thought that he himself was right.  Moreover, he attacked   
strongly, not my opinion but me personally."
7367,sadness,"When I learnt that I had failed an exam,  This not only influenced  
my emotions but also other important tasks, it also made my  
record imperfect."
7368,disgust,"[ I would classify subjectively, a certain gesture or the way of  
talking of a person as disgusting or inacceptable.]"
7369,shame,"One day I felt dizzy during a lecture.  When the lecturer asked  
us as to who had heard the fairy tale - I was the only one who  
put up his hand and this surprised the whole class."
7370,guilt,"We always made a lot of noise during a certain lecture.  This may  
have been because we did not respect the lecturer. Finaly, the  
lecturer could not tolerate it and he scolded us angrily and  
pointed out our misbehaviour."
7371,joy,"I felt happy when I received the letter telling me that I had  
been admitted to the university."
7372,fear,"During the first year in university I had bad results in both  
the terms, especially the first term.  I was afraid that  I would  
not be promoted to the next year and that the others would go  
ahead of me."
7373,anger,Once my father slapped my mother for a small quarrel.
7374,sadness,"A few years ago my mother suffered from canccer and died within  
two years.  We had not finished our studies then and could not  
bear our responsibilities as her children.  My mother had tried  
her best to take care of us but she lived in pain these two  
years.  Neither the doctor nor we could do anything for her as  
cancer is incurable.  I was very eager to replace her in  
suffernig , even die instead of her."
7375,disgust,"I used to play with a group of classmates and I found out later  
that they were cheap in thought, behaviour and conduct - they  
would smoke, fight and speak foul language.  I thought that they  
destroyed the image of college students."
7376,shame,"It was discovered that I had received a warning letter as my  
G.P.A was very low."
7377,guilt,"Many years back I quarrelled with my younger brother for a small  
reason.  I used a pole to beat him and nearly broke his arm.  He  
recovered after a treatment which lasted several months.  After  
this our relationship was worse and he would not listen to me."
7378,joy,"One Saturday afternoon, I deliberately dressed up nicely (I had  
been in a bad mood of late).  I hoped to go for a walk in the  
soft sunlight to try and uplift my spirits.  When I was having  
lunch in the canteen, two of my male classmates asked me as to  
why I was dressed so nicely (they had seldom joked with me  
before).  One of them said that he had a lounge suit and we would  
look very nice if we wore them together."
7379,fear,"The exam was drawing near and I wanted to prepare for it.  But I  
had a lot of other things to do so I did not have much time to prepare   
for the exams.  Whenever I sat down to study I was scared that I would   
not be able to finish it."
7380,anger,"A female classmate was always late for meetings which were for  
the homework and not social gatherings.  We were very busy and  
the deadline was close but we had to waste half an hour or an  
hour waiting for her as we could do nothing else then."
7381,sadness,"After a meeting ended we started talking about when we would  
have the next discussion ( I had many tests the coming week and  
could not have a meeting in between, I thought that they would  
understand this as they had always done).  They did not  
understand my problem and thought that I should not have so many  
other activities.  Their reaction made me burst into tears."
7382,disgust,"When I was studying in the library a pair of lovers were sitting  
next to me talking in an intense and soft voice.  They were  
disturbing others."
7383,shame,"During an informal discussion I contributed a lot even though I  
had not spent much time studying.  Whenever someone said that  
someone was not paying attention, or that he had too many other  
things to do, or that the persoon was not trying his best, I  
would feel ashamed."
7384,guilt,"Our class had organized a picnic in November.  I was the class  
representative so I became the organizor.  However the picnic  
was postponed by one week and I had something else to do then.  
Initially I did not ponder on what to do and decided to go for  
the picnic.  When I had the time to think about it I thought that  
my decision was wrong.  My classmates thought that I would go as  
I had signed my name but I did not go.  I told another class  
representative that I was not going but he did not know the  
reason behind my not going.  After the picnic my classmates asked  
me why I had not gone to the picnic and everytime someone  
mentioned it I was apologetic.  I should have decided right in  
the begining that I would not go and then they would not see me  
as irresponsible i.e promising to go and changing my mind  
afterwards."
7385,joy,"It was the first time I met him (my boyfriend Mr.W).  It was  
during the first term Summer vacations.  We met each other while  
handing in our homework.  He invited me have a trip with him and  
we were together till 8 P.M."
7386,fear,"The day the results of the certificate exam came out.  I went to  
school and at first I did not feel frightened.  By the time I  
reached the fourth floor ( the results were being given on the  
fifth floor) I found it difficult to walk and felt that I would  
die."
7387,anger,"One day I had sunned my favourite shirt and was putting it back  
in the wardrobe when my younger brother snatched it from me and  
wore it.  He had not had a bath and was very dirty.  I scolded him  
but he answered back and locked himself up in a room.  I was very  
angry so I starteed kicking on the door and abusing him loudly  
and freely."
7388,sadness,"When I was a child I was playing on the upper deck of the bed  
with my brother.  My parents slept on the lower deck.  My father  
felt disgusted and beat me up.  I felt very sad as my father had  
never beaten me or scolded me before."
7389,disgust,"My boyfriend and I did not have any contact with each other during   
the Summer holidays.  I met him the day of the registration and looked   
through him.  In the canteen he asked me if I wanted to have a drink and   
I said no as I did not want him to do me a favour."
7390,shame,"On Christmas eve I went to a classmate's home with other  
classmates.  The next morning when I came out of the toilet she  
said something and I did not understand what she was saying.

to zip them up.  I rushed back to the toilet but by the time the  
others had guessed what had happened."
7391,guilt,"One night,when I was in primary 5 or 6, I felt thirsty so I

water on his head."

We were in a flurry but at that time I felt the love and concern  
of my friends."

a hotel.  The room I was staying in was very silent and had very  
dim lights.  The last night I felt frightened and lay awake - I  
could hear some sounds around me and dared not open my eyes - I  
waited for dawn."
7394,anger,"I had a very good friend in secondary school.  The year after our  
graduation I prepared to celebrate her birthday and I called off  
all my appointments.  I got together the other friends and we  
were ready to give the entire day to her.  However this friend  
disappeared on her birthday.  When I phoned another friend I  
didcovered thay she was busy, I did not call her anymore."
7395,sadness,"I am a Christian but I cannot find any meaning in life . It  
seems that I am deceiving myself but I cannot find the way out."

and talked to me for half an hour or more.  However there was  
nothing important in the conversation and I found the person very  
disgusting."
7397,shame,I felt shame when I found that I was almost last in the exam.
7398,guilt,"Once I bought my sister a pair of sports shoes as she was going

mother about it.  When my mother learnt this she beat her up and  
even threatened her with a pair of scissors.  "
7402,sadness,"My academic result was poor and I had to repeat the second year.

She treated us strictly and punished us physically.   These  
things were intolerable."

when I was talking to her, her boyfriend appeared and I felt  
ashamed."

I tried my best."
7415,anger,"I had a date with my girlfriend, the time and place had not been

youth center with a few other volunteers.  I was the head of the  
organizors and we spent over a month planning it.  During this  
period we got to know and understood each other.  We  
discovered each others potential and we planned many interesting  
things for the carnival.  The day of the carnival everything was  
bright, the programmes went well and the attendants enjoyed it.   
I felt extremely excited about it."
7421,anger,"I was a prefect at secondary school.  On the sports day I told  
others that I would take down the names of the people who  
misbehaved and after some time I sat down for a brief rest.   
Suddenly the head prefect came and scolded me in front of others.  
 I was very angry as there were other prefects sitting and he  
picked on me.  I thought that a brief rest was not  serious  
enough to be blamed."
7422,disgust,"I had joined a youth group that observed the affairs of our  
community and so I had many opportunities to contact the  
government and the committee members of the district board (a  
local executive structure).  We always tried to consult and  
discuss with them, but we found that such people did not  
understand community affairs and they even dampened our  
enthusiasm in local affairs.  I did not understand why they had  
decided to work as community leaders."
7423,shame,"One day I was the leader of the weekly meeting of the Church  
fellowship.  That day I had been preparing for the exams and did

meeting badly.  I was ashamed of myself.  "
7424,guilt,"I borrowed my classmate's notebook one week before the  
examination and I promised to give it back to her in two days  
time.  I was very busy at that time and forgot many things; as I  
was not very often at home she could not contact me.  When I

It was not a great loss from the monetary point of view but I  
lost some documents - identity papers.  As a result I had to  
spend several days in order to get a new one.  I will always  
remember all the work I had to do and the bad treatment I  
suffered because of the bureaucratic behaviour of the civil  
servant.  I had already had bad luck and they treated me like a  
criminal.   At one point of time I really wanted to quarrel with

7431,guilt,"Once, my friend and I went to the Tai 60 to cycle.  My mother had  
told me not to go.  Unfortunately I broke my pectoral girdle and  
had to go to hospital.  When my mother  came to see me I felt  
guilty as I had not listened to her and I had to soon sit for a  
public examination."
7432,joy,"After attending a song contest proposed by a band called ""Chyne""  
we (6 of us) waited for the members of the band to greet us in  
front of the stage.  We went out after a few minutes as it was  
time to close the hall.  We had been waiting at the entrance hall  
for ten minutes when three of the band members came out.  They  
were very excited to see us, one of them was so excited that he  
had tears in his eyes.  We felt very warm and close to each  
other.  They took us back into the hall and we talked freely.  We  
were together for about an hour and during this time we felt  
that they were very sincere."
7433,fear,"At noon one Sunday I received a phone call telling me that my  
mother had been knocked down by a car at the street crossing and

boxes.  However I immediately ran to the scene of the accident."

should have been very happy; however my grandmother, because of   
her prejudice and misunderstanding, started a  quarrel with my  
mother.  She expected me to take her side and she deliberately  
talked of my mother's wrong doings.  I was very angry because -  
one my grandmother was not being reasonable and two because it  
should have been a happy day and three we had moved into a new  
house that day."
7435,sadness,"When I was in lower six class during the Summer I joined a  
research group of the Chinese university student union.  I knew

after coming back to H.K.  We all got together for the funeral  
and when I looked at the body for the last time I felt extremely  
sad."
7436,disgust,"During these Summer vacations a schoolmate who was not in my  
class went to Britain.  Before he left, his classmates and some  
of us who were accquainted with him had a B.B.Q on the beach.   
When I arrived I saw that some people , who were not close  
friends of the departing person(person A), were playing mahjong.   
Some others were playing bridge and A had nothing to do, besides  
it was A who had prepared the food.  Later when we wanted to talk  
and his classmates did not even have the decency to listen to him.   
They only asked him a few questions half-heartedly and then they  
talked on their own.  Some of their conversation was against me and   
another classmate."

interview the general public.  One of my friends in the group  
lost her purse and she was very nervous.  Five of us had to go  
another place so we left her, and planned to see her later.  Then

had seen her purse on the floor and had not wanted to do any  
thing about it. "
7438,guilt,"I went to a friend's baptism as she became a Christian after me  
and I realized that she was more enthusiastic about her spiritual  
life than I was.  When I was with my brothers and sisters of  
Christ I had a guilty feeling which could not be dismissed  
easily.  When pepole asked me as to when I would be baptised my  
guilt feeling deepened."

Before getting into the bus I had prepared the exact amount of  
coins to pay for the bus fair and when I got into the bus I put  
these coins into the box meant to collect the bus fair.  I  
thought that I had paid and wanted to get inside.  However the  
bus driver called me and asked me in an impolite way if the coins  
were stuck at the opening  of the box.  He had not seen me paying  
and there wasn't a stack of coins in the box.  I could not  
understand this and the driver kept questioning me.  He made me  
feel angry and at last i inserted a dollar coin in the box just  
to get away from him.  Later I found that I had forgotten a few  
coins in my pocket and had not paid enough for the fair the first  
time.  After I had entered the bus I could still hear him  
scolding me and I felt disgusted."

very poor.  I really felt ashamed."
